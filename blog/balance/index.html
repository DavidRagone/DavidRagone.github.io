<p>I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised seeing such things from Apple (the company
building a campus with everything but a daycare), but I still can&rsquo;t believe this
ad. It reminds me of an interesting discussion I had with a former manager about
what and how we celebrate wins, and how that defines our culture and norms.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure everyone has made sacrifices to accomplish something. Deciding trade
offs between different approaches is a core part of not just software
engineering, but also of life. I&rsquo;ve certainly made choices that have hurt
relationships, some goals, and my short term happiness in favor of an expected
long-term payoff.</p>

<p>But when a company decides to celebrate the effort (&ldquo;we really appreciate how
Bob worked late into the night and over the weekend to get this done&rdquo;), it sets
the boundaries for defining success. It becomes not about the accomplishment,
but the sacrifice made to get there. Effort should be appreciated, but
highlighting company-wide sets expectations for everyone else, and define a
value of personal sacrifice for group gain. I know there are some companies (and
industries) that are perfectly fine with this, but I&rsquo;m not interested in being a
part of them. I believe that people can create something amazing while also
having reasonable boundaries that allow them to be well-rounded. This is a
fundamental belief I inherited from the Jesuits, and I am greatly for their
influence on me here.</p>
